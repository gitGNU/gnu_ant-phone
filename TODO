Bugs:
=====
* Due to unsynchronized ISDN and ALSA clocks, there are still some issues with
  audio overruns/unterruns, which may cause slight distortions in the sound
  quality. This can only by addressed by stretching/contracting sound segments.
  Currently it is handled by duplicating small frames (~20ms) on underruns or
  skipping small frames (~20ms) on overruns. In some rare cases, however,
  it happens frequently for up to a minute. Hanging up and redialing is one
  option how to get rid of this problem.
* Audio device choosing is still done via textbox. With ALSA now, it should be
  done via combobox, as device names can be queried.
* Surely some new ones after rewrite of large parts of the code...

Feature requests:
=================
* Real time support
   => not really necessary anymore, but can be easily implemented now
* client/server architecture (ttyI network forward) (Sven Geggus <sven@gegg.us>, Arne Börs <Arne.Boers@gmx.de>, martin@stigge.org)
   => can be now handled by remote CAPI, no need for special code
* Makeln (Joerg Brueggemann <jb@neviges.net>)
* database connection (caller id, times of incoming / outgoing, ...)

Christoph Schütz <ch.schuetz@addcom.de>:
* echo compensation
* configurable different ringtones (for different callers)
